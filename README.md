# Recipe Explorer

## Overview
I am developing an app that uses [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/) to suggest three recipes based on a chosen main ingredient and 2-3 additional ingredients. The goal is to help people who seek variety in their meals.

## Key Features
1. **Ingredients:** Focus on a single main ingredient and additional ingredients for unique recipe suggestions.
2. **API Integration:** Utilize [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/) to gather recipes.
3. **Database Schema:** Develop a database for recipes, ingredients, instructions, and user preferences.
4. **Security Measures:** Implement Bcrypt for password encryption and use salts for security.
5. **CRUD:** Implement CRUD by adding items to lists (Create), view items in a list (Read), change items in a list (Update), and delete items from a list (Delete).
6. **Unit Tests:** Implement unit tests to ensure the functionality of key components, maintain code quality, and prevent regressions during development. This includes testing models, routes, and API integrations.

## Stretch Goals
I plan to include features like a shopping list generator, recipe categories (spicy, savory, sweet), nutritional information, and the ability to filter recipes by cooking time.
