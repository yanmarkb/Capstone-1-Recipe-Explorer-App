## Additional Notes
This project is a part of my capstone project. It is designed to showcase my skills in full-stack web development, particularly in Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy. I chose to implement these features to provide a useful tool for meal planning and to demonstrate my ability to integrate with APIs.
